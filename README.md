A simple sinewave generator for abstract art made with matplotlib in python.

Modify the waves variable to change the number of waves in the picture.

Modify the height_added variable to change the amount of height added for each next wave.

Modify the frequency_range variable to change the max frequency.

Note that each wave is made by adding 10 sinewaves which the range of frequency are determined by the frequency_range variable.
